  <title>A geometric approach to solutions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      You now know that a first-order differential equation <m>\ydot = f(y,t)</m> defines a slope field in the <m>(t,y)</m> plane.  It seems reasonable that a solution to this differential equation must be related to this slope field in some way.  In this section we focus on the geometric relationship between the slope field and solutions.

          Below are two figures showing slope fields defined by some first-order differential equation <m>\ydot = f(y,t).</m>  Clicking on the field draws a solution curve through that point.  Informally, what is the relationship between the slopes and the curves?
