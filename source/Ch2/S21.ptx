  <title>A geometric approach to solutions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      You now know that a first-order differential equation <m>\ydot = f(y,t)</m> defines a slope field in the <m>(t,y)</m> plane.  It seems reasonable that a solution to this differential equation must be related to this slope field in some way.  In this section we focus on the geometric relationship between the slope field and solutions.

        <p>
          Below are two figures showing slope fields defined by some first-order differential equation <m>\ydot = f(y,t).</m>  Clicking on the field draws a solution curve through that point.  Informally, what is the relationship between the slopes and the curves?
