  <title>What is an Ordinary Differential Equation?</title>
  <introduction>
    <p> We're all familiar with the idea of an algebraic equation. Something like <m>2x+1 = 5</m> or <m>
      ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>. A solution to an algebraic equation is a number, or collection of
      numbers, that make the statement true. </p>
    <p> So what if we have an equation like this? <md>
        <mrow>
          f(x)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + g(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + h(x) =
          c?
        </mrow>
      </md>
      It's still an equation, so we're still interested in what makes it true. However, the
      assumption has changed. We don't need a numerical value to make this true, we need some
      differentiable function <m>y(x)</m>. Conceptually, there isn't a difference, just
      procedurally. We're still trying to find a way to make a statement containing unknown values
      true. </p>
