  <title>The Terminology of Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    As is true in any discipline, we need to begin by making sure that we have an understanding of the language to describe differential equations.  This section introduces most of the terms and notation that we will be using throughout this book.

    <p> A differential equation is simply an equation that describes a relationship between some function and its derivatives.  We will often use the variable <m>y</m> to denote the function (or dependent variable), the variable <m>t</m> to denote the input (or independent variable), and primes to denote derivatives.  Here are a few examples to give you the idea.
<ol>
<li><m> y' = a y (1-y)</m> </li>
  <li><m> y' = -9.8 t + 12</m> </li>
    <li><m> y''+\omega^2 y = 0</m> </li>
      <li><m> y''+ ky' + \omega^2 y = \sin t</m> </li>
</ol> </p>

<p>
  The goal of this book is to provide you with tools for 
<ul>
<li> understanding differential equations, </li>
  <li> using differential equations, and</li>
    <li> solving differential equations (when possible).</li>
</ul>
