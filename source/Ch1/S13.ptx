  <title>Visualizing Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>The place to start studying ordinary differential equations is to develop a way to visualize the equation.  This process isn't new to you, before you learned doing algebra, you learned how to visualize graphs.  Before you stared doing derivatives, you learned how to visualize tangent lines.  The same process is important here.  This section will help you visualize first-order differential equations partly because it helps you understand what comes later.  But we also hope that you will see that using these methods are useful in their own right and much understanding and interpretation can be gained using some pretty basic ideas.</p>
  </introduction>
  

<p> The techniques you will explore here apply to differential equations of the form
<men xml:id="eqODE1">
\ydot = f(y,t)</men>


where the function <m>f</m> is assumed to be differentiable in both <m>y</m>  and <m>t</m> .  Note that if the differential equation is autonomous then <m>f(y,t) = f(y).</m>  </p>

    <title>Conjecture</title>
   <p> Autonomous differential equations of the form 
<men xml:id="autODE"> 
\ydot = f(y) </men>

are especially important.  They arise in modeling because it is often the case that the rate of change of some variable (<m>\ydot</m>) depends on the size of that variable (<m>y</m>) but not on time (<m>t</m>).  Here is a simple example that you are probably familiar with:  the rate of growth of a population is proportional to population size.  If <m>y</m> is population size then this gives the differential equation
<m> \ydot = ky </m>
with <m>k>0</m> the constant of proportionality.

The following exercises point to a few important properties of slope fields of autonomous differential equations defined by equation <xref ref="autODE"/>.

      What is the relationship between the slopes assigned to the points <m>(t_0, y_0)</m> and <m>(t_1,y_0)</m>?  In general, what is true about the slopes assigned to points on a horizontal line <m>y=y_0</m>?

    <p> As mentioned briefly above, differential equations can be used to mathematically model many real-world phenomenon because it is often convenient to describe the rate of change of a quantity in terms of the quantity itself.  The following exercises illustrate some typical problems.  It is typical that a constant (such as a constant of proportionality) will be required.  You should use a letter (like <m>k</m> above) for this and specify the sign of the constant where appropriate.  You should <em> not</em> assign a value to this constant unless additional information is provided that allows you to do so.</p>

        This question concerns a property of solutions to autonomous differential equations.  It will be helpful to review your responses to conjectures <xref ref="conj_autslopes1"/> - <xref ref="conj_autslopes4"/> in answering this question.  Do you think that a solution to an autonomous differential equation can have a local maximum or local minimum?  Why or why not?
